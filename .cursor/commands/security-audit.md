# Backend Security Audit

## Overview

Comprehensive security review to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Dependencies

- [ ] Run `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies
- [ ] Check for vulnerabilities with `govulncheck`
- [ ] Review indirect dependencies for known issues
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Pin dependency versions (no floating versions)

## Secrets & Credentials

- [ ] No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens
- [ ] No secrets in environment variable defaults
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged or exposed in errors
- [ ] Use secret management (environment variables, vault, etc.)
- [ ] Database credentials not in code or version control

## Input Validation

- [ ] All user input is validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (prepared statements, parameterized queries)
- [ ] Command injection prevented (avoid `os/exec` with user input)
- [ ] Path traversal prevented (validate file paths)
- [ ] XXE attacks prevented (secure XML parsing)
- [ ] Request size limits implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

## Authentication

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt or argon2
- [ ] No plain text password storage
- [ ] JWT tokens properly validated and signed
- [ ] Session tokens are cryptographically random
- [ ] Token expiration implemented
- [ ] Secure password reset flow

## Authorization

- [ ] Access control checks on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Users can only access their own resources
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented correctly
- [ ] No privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- [ ] API endpoints require proper authentication

## Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] TLS/HTTPS enforced for data in transit
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] PII handling complies with regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] Secure random number generation (crypto/rand, not math/rand)

## API Security

- [ ] CORS configured correctly (not using wildcard `*` in production)
- [ ] Content-Type validation
- [ ] CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] No verbose error messages exposing internals
- [ ] Security headers set (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Environment variables used for configuration
- [ ] No debug/development features in production
- [ ] Database connections use least privilege principle
- [ ] File permissions properly restricted
- [ ] Timeouts set for HTTP clients and servers

## Crypto

- [ ] Use Go's `crypto` package (not custom crypto)
- [ ] No weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for security purposes)
- [ ] Proper random generation with `crypto/rand`
- [ ] TLS minimum version set to 1.2 or higher
